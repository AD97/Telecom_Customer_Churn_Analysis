# Telecom Customer Curn Analysis
Customer churn is a problem that every telecom company faces. Telecom companies spend a lot
of money on their customers and it is very important for them to analyse the behaviour of the
customer so that they do not plan to leave the services. Currently there is a lot of competition in
the telecom industry as the competitor companies come up with better plans or offers , which
compel the customer to leave the telecom service provider. To solve this problem we have used
machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, k nearest neighbor, decision tree , naive bayes
and neural network which will help us to predict on what factors customers plan to leave.
